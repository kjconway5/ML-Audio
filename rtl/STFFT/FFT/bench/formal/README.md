This directory contains several SymbiYosys scripts useful for formally verifying parts and pieces of the design. While the top level of the design has yet to be formally verified, scripts are present for verifying all of the other components--save the long binary multiply, longbimpy. The properties within the long binary multiply only proves certain properties of the binary multiply. The full proof is done by exhaustion via Verilator in the bench/cpp directory.

Within the defaults.h there's a formal_property_flag used for controlling whether or not the formal properties are included into the RTL files.
